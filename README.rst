Lanelet maps: ``liblanelet``
============================

----

**lanelet2**

*Do you want to use lanelet maps in a new more structured way, well prepared for future autonomous driving applications?*

There is `lanelet2 <https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2>`_ released now. The successor of liblanelet (which will now be called *lanelet1*).

More here: https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2

If you still use lanelet1, consider using the lanelet2 `validator <https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2/tree/master/lanelet2_validation>`_ to check your maps for compatibility with lanelet2.

More info about the differences between lanelet1 and lanelet2 can be found `here <https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2/blob/master/lanelet2_core/doc/Lanelet1Compability.md>`_.

Lanelet maps [#laneletpaper]_ have been introduced in the context of the autonomous
completion of the Bertha-Benz-Memorial-Route in 2013 [#presse]_.

The lanelet concept includes a map specification as well as an editing
tool chain. The lanelet maps are built on top of

* ``liblanelet`` (provided here)
* the OpenStreetMap (OSM) file format [#osmformat]_
* JOSM, the Java OSM editor [#josm]_
* The RAILS port, which provides the OSM server [#rails]_
* ``osmosis`` to retrieve bigger portions of the map from the database [#osmosis]_
* ``icmaker`` making CMakeLists.txt files more readable [#icmaker]_
* ``icl_core`` giving nice logging features [#icl_core]_

All components are open source so that users can profit from lanelet maps immediately.

Warning: Although the infractructure of OSM plays a key role in this toolchain, lanelet maps *are not* and *will never* be part of the OSM data base. So please *do not* upload your maps to the official OSM data base - instead, use the RAILS port and set up your own server where you can host your maps.

liblanelet
==============

``liblanelet`` is a library which

* parses OSM XML files
* builds the lanelet map
* provides access to the attributes of lanelets and regulatory elements
* allows routing through the graph

With version 1.1 a lot of new features arrived. Some of them are:

* support for lanelet center lines
* new projection and localization methods
* request methods for neighbouring lanelets
* request methods for possible routes from a given lanelet
* support for parking spaces
* routing from and to parking spaces
* export of lanelet maps
* lanelet graph export for visualization in josm and graph editors

It is licensed under BSD. See the `LICENSE.md <LICENSE.md>`_ file for more details.

Quickstart
==========

* Follow the install instructions given in the `INSTALL.md <INSTALL.md>`_ file (especially about the depedencies) and `this video <http://youtu.be/K2GKEDoe7ck>`_
* Make a map and parse it with liblanelet (there is `a video <http://youtu.be/284xfabEUZ4>`_ as well)
* Use ``liblanelet`` in your software. A good point to start is `demo.cpp <src/liblanelet/demo.cpp>`_ as well as the test cases in `lanelet_tests.cpp <src/tests/lanelet_tests.cpp>`_.
    
Configuring JOSM
================

Additionally, the archive contains
a JOSM style file as well as the corresponding icons. To activate the style in JOSM,

* press ``F12`` to get into the configuration dialog
* in the third tab (titled *settings for the map projection*), go to *Map Paint Styles* and press the ``+`` to add the style sheet. In the area below, append the icon directory to the list.

  for right bounds.
  
Don't forget to configure JOSM to use your OSM server instead of the official one.

Common pitfalls
===============

The thing with the OSM-IDs
  JOSM does not know about global IDs. So when you create new elements, they will have a negative ID which indicates that the element is not known
  to the OSM server (*your* server). As soon as this element is uploaded, the server will assign a globally unique ID which is stable at least
  during the element's life. Until then, JOSM displays 0 as ID unless you hange `osm-primitives.showid.new-primitives` to `true` in ``Preferences`` / ``[x] Expert mode`` / ``Advanced Preferences``.

The thing with the node identity
  Points (or better *nodes*) are considered identical if they have the same ID. It is not sufficient to place two different points near each other. Usually
  this causes trouble with lanelet adjacency.

Why not use the OSM server?
  OSM refers to two things: the collected data and the agreement of the community on how to map and what to map, and the infrastructure part, which is the file format, the tile structure, editing software and the database. Lanelet maps build on top of the infrastructure part. They are meaningless to OSM mappers and uploading your maps to official OSM servers will cause trouble.
